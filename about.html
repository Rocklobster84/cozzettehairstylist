        I have had so many wonderful opportunities since I started this career over 16 years ago. I love getting to
        know new people and engaging with my clients. They truly become my friends and family. I wouldn’t have it any
        other way! I am a mother of two children, and a teenage step-daughter. I know what it’s like to be busy, because of that my goal is to make each client feel stylish, while still having a look they can maintain on a daily basis, without me! I offer almost every service from color, men’s services, women’s services, even perms and relaxers. I rarely have openings on weekends or evenings because I’m completely booked but if that’s what you need you can always text me for last minute openings. I DO have day time spots open. I offer a 10-minute color. That allows you to get a single color applied, rinsed, and styled in a hour if you want to take a lunch break for a hair service. Message me for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Public service announcement. Since appointment times are limited, please arrive on time and if you are more
        than 15 minutes late, I will have to reschedule you and charge a fee for half the scheduled service price for
        the missed appointment. If I’m late, I try my hardest to text you ahead of time. I double book most days. It
        is a domino effect, so I always try to be respectful of your time and mine.

            My Name is Salena Mason. I was born and raised in Fort Worth, TX. I love traveling, and anything that involves my husky and blue heeler. I’m recently engaged and just loving life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve always imagined owning my own business and giving my guests the best services. My goal is to always provide my clients with the most innovative skincare products and treatments. I have just recently moved to BB 63 Salon, located in the same strip as the historic Ridglea Theater bldg.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been working professionally as a esthetician for several years and gained a lot of experience with my diverse clientele and services I offer.  My number one passion in life is skincare. I really do enjoy making my clients feel beautiful and the connections that come along with it.
          </p>

            I am Tiffany! Ever since I received my esthetics license I haven't looked back. I Started up Fabulous Faces by Tiffany to give my guests the best cosmetic services, and experience possible. I have worked in the healthcare industry for many years prior so it just made sense to merge to the cosmetic side.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in botox injections, permanent makeup, micro blading, many types of facials and fillers. If you want to keep your youthful appearance or if you are curious if any of these services are for you, please message me. I can help you look and feel your best.
